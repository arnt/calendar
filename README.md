A wall calendar in Postscript
=============================

This is the hack we use to keep track of the coming months, written in
Postscript. It's exactly as high as our printer can manage (ISO B0), as
wide as there's space for on the kitchen door, and is optimised for
writing space.

All the commercially available calendars tell us that August 15 is some
sort of religious holiday, which is important to the pope but less so to
us. What we want is space to write. And a bit of overlap with next
year, and the whole thing must fit the kitchen door.

I meant to add birthday support this year. It didn't happen. Maybe next
year. Must learn how to do file I/O in Postscript then.
